## Phase 6: Follow-up Suggestions & Recommendations

**Generate Based on Content Analysis:**

- **Immediate Actions** (24-48 hours): Extracted from explicit commitments
- **Short-term Follow-up** (1-2 weeks): Inferred from discussion momentum
- **Long-term Tracking** (ongoing): Based on project/strategic discussions
- **Clarification Questions**: Directly addressing flagged ambiguities
- **Suggested Next Steps**: Logical progression from current discussion

**Scope Boundaries**: Frame as "Extracted Recommendations" from conversation content, not newly generated project management advice.
